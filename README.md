# 🧮 Calculator App

A simple calculator built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. This project supports basic arithmetic operations, keyboard input, and error handling. It’s designed as a beginner-friendly project to understand DOM manipulation, event handling, and simple JavaScript logic.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Basic arithmetic operations: `+`, `-`, `×`, `÷`
- Handles brackets `(` and `)`
- Decimal point support
- Keyboard input support:
  - Numbers and operators work directly from the keyboard
  - `Enter` → Calculate result
  - `Backspace` → Delete last character
  - `C` → Clear the display
- Error handling (invalid expressions show `Error`)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **HTML** → Structure
- **CSS** → Styling (grid layout, responsive design)
- **JavaScript** → Functionality (event listeners, calculations)

## 📖 How It Works
1. **Display Area** shows the input and results.
2. **Buttons / Keyboard** update the display.
3. **Calculate Function** replaces `×` with `*` and `÷` with `/`, then uses `eval()` to compute the result.
4. **Clear & Backspace** functions reset or update the display accordingly.

## ⚡ Usage
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Start calculating 🎉
